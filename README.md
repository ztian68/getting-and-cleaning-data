course project for getting-and-cleaning-data
R code file: run_analysis.R
current working directory should be UCI HAR Dataset, so there are two sub directory: test and train, read in data from these two directories.
6 activity labels as 6 column names for each volunteer, total are 30 volunteers, total 180 columns
number 1 volunteer 6 columns lables as following
WALKING.1
WALKING_UPSTAIRS.1
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS.1
SITTING.1
STANDING.1
LAYING.1

other volunteer 6 columns labels are following the above example

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-X,Y,Z
tGravityAcc-X,Y,Z
tBodyAccJerk-X,Y,Z
tBodyGyro-X,Y,Z
tBodyGyroJerk-X,Y,Z
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-X,Y,Z
fBodyAccJerk-X,Y,Z
fBodyGyro-X,Y,Z
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:
-mean: Mean value
-std: Standard deviation
-meanFreq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
